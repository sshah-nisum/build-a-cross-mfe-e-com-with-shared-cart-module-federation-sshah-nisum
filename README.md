# Assignment 2 — MFE Assignment: Cross-MFE E-Commerce App with Shared Cart State

## 📌 Overview

In this assignment, you will build a small **E-Commerce application using Micro Frontends (MFEs)** and **Module Federation**.

The application will consist of multiple independently developed and deployed Micro Frontends that communicate and share data with each other.

The primary goal of this assignment is to understand and demonstrate the **Data-Sharing Toolbox** introduced in Lecture 2:

- `localStorage`
- `sessionStorage`
- Cookies
- Query Parameters
- Custom Events
- Shared Redux State through Module Federation

You will implement a **Product Catalog MFE** and a **Shopping Cart MFE**, and demonstrate how data can be passed between these independent applications using different state/data-sharing mechanisms.

> **Important:** The goal is not only to make the application work. You must also explain **when, why, and where each data-sharing mechanism should be used**, including its advantages and limitations.

---

# 📦 Required Project Structure

Your repository should follow a structure similar to:

```text
mfe-ecommerce/
│
├── host/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
│
├── catalog-mfe/

│
├── shared/
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md
```

You may choose a different structure if your architecture is clearly documented.

---

# 🔄 Part 1 — Module Federation Setup

Configure Module Federation so that the Host application can consume the Catalog and Cart MFEs independently.

For example:

```text
Host
 ├── Catalog MFE
 └── Cart MFE
```

The MFEs should be exposed remotely and consumed by the Host application.

### Requirements

- Catalog MFE must be independently runnable.
- Cart MFE must be independently runnable.
- Host must consume both MFEs.
- MFEs should not be directly copied into the Host application.
- Remote modules should be loaded using Module Federation.

---

# 🛒 Part 2 — Basic E-Commerce Functionality

Implement the following functionality.

## Product Catalog

The Catalog MFE should display a minimum of **8 products**.

Example:

```text
Product
-------------------------
Name: Wireless Headphones
Price: $99
Description: ...
[Add to Cart]
```

Users should be able to click:

```text
Add to Cart
```

and the selected product should become available to the Cart MFE.

---

## Shopping Cart

The Cart MFE should display:

```text
Shopping Cart

Wireless Headphones
$99
Quantity: 2

Wireless Mouse
$49
Quantity: 1

--------------------
Total Items: 3
Total: $247
```

Users should be able to:

- Add items
- Remove items
- Increase quantity
- Decrease quantity
- Clear the cart
- View total items
- View total price

---

# 🧰 Part 3 — Data-Sharing Toolbox

This is the **core part of the assignment**.

You must demonstrate how data can be shared between independent MFEs using the following mechanisms.

---

# 1️⃣ localStorage

Use `localStorage` to persist cart-related information.

### Requirement

When a user adds an item to the cart:

```text
Catalog MFE
     ↓
localStorage
     ↓
Cart MFE
```

The cart should remain available even after refreshing the browser.

### Demonstrate

- Saving cart data.
- Reading cart data.
- Updating cart data.
- Removing cart data.
- Handling an empty cart.

### Example

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("cart", JSON.stringify(cart));
```

### Explain

In your documentation, explain:

- Why localStorage is useful.
- What happens when the browser is refreshed.
- Whether localStorage is shared between MFEs.
- Security considerations.
- Limitations of localStorage.

---

# 2️⃣ sessionStorage

Use `sessionStorage` for temporary information.

### Requirement

Use `sessionStorage` to store something such as:

```text
currentProduct
recentlyViewedProduct
checkoutStep
```

For example:

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("recentProduct", JSON.stringify(product));
```

### Demonstrate

The stored information should be available while the browser tab/session remains active.

### Explain

Document:

- Difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
- When sessionStorage is more appropriate.
- What happens when the browser/tab is closed.
- Whether sessionStorage should be used for persistent cart state.

---

# 3️⃣ Cookies

Use cookies to share a small piece of information between the applications.

### Requirement

Store information such as:

```text
currency=USD
```

or:

```text
cartSessionId=12345
```

Example:

```javascript
document.cookie = "currency=USD; path=/";
```

### Demonstrate

The application should read the cookie from another MFE.

### Explain

Document:

- What cookies are.
- When cookies are appropriate.
- Cookie size limitations.
- `HttpOnly`
- `Secure`
- `SameSite`
- Why sensitive information should not be stored in normal client-readable cookies.

---

# 4️⃣ Query Parameters

Use URL query parameters to share information between MFEs.

### Requirement

Implement a flow such as:

```text
/catalog/product/10
```

or:

```text
/catalog?productId=10
```

For example:

```text
/cart?coupon=SAVE10
```

The Cart MFE should be able to read the parameter.

### Example

```javascript
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

const productId = params.get("productId");
```

### Demonstrate

Use query parameters for information that should be:

- Shareable
- Bookmarkable
- Visible in the URL
- Preserved when navigating between applications

### Explain

Discuss:

- Advantages of query parameters.
- URL visibility.
- Security implications.
- Appropriate use cases.

---

# 5️⃣ Custom Events

Use browser Custom Events to communicate between the Catalog and Cart MFEs.

### Requirement

When a user clicks:

```text
Add to Cart
```

the Catalog MFE should dispatch a custom event.

Example:

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent("cart:item-added", {
    detail: product,
  }),
);
```

The Cart MFE should listen for this event:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("cart:item-added", handleAddToCart);
```

### Demonstrate

The following flow should work:

```text
Catalog MFE
     │
     │ CustomEvent
     ▼
Browser Window
     │
     ▼
Cart MFE
```

### Explain

Document:

- Why Custom Events are useful.
- Advantages of loose coupling.
- Limitations of Custom Events.
- How event naming should be handled.
- What happens if the receiving MFE is not mounted.

---

# 6️⃣ Shared Redux State via Module Federation

This is the **most important implementation requirement**.

You must demonstrate sharing Redux state between the Catalog and Cart MFEs through Module Federation.

The goal is to create a shared cart state such as:

```javascript
{
  cart: {
    items: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Wireless Headphones",
        price: 99,
        quantity: 2
      }
    ],
    totalItems: 2,
    totalPrice: 198
  }
}
```

---

## Shared Redux Architecture

The expected architecture is:

```text
                 ┌─────────────────────┐
                 │   Shared Redux Store │
                 │                     │
                 │   cartSlice         │
                 └──────────┬──────────┘
                            │
                 ┌──────────┴──────────┐
                 │                     │
          ┌──────▼──────┐       ┌──────▼──────┐
          │ Catalog MFE │       │   Cart MFE   │
          │             │       │              │
          │ dispatch()  │       │ useSelector()│
          └─────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

### Requirements

The shared Redux state should contain at least:

```text
cart.items
cart.totalItems
cart.totalPrice
```

The Catalog MFE should be able to:

```text
dispatch(addToCart(product))
```

The Cart MFE should be able to:

```text
useSelector(state => state.cart)
```

The state must be shared rather than maintaining two unrelated Redux stores.

---

# 🔗 Module Federation Shared Dependencies

Ensure dependencies such as React and Redux are configured correctly to avoid multiple instances where appropriate.

For example:

```text
react
react-dom
react-redux
@reduxjs/toolkit
```

should be configured appropriately as shared dependencies.

You must document your Module Federation configuration and explain why these dependencies are shared.

---

# 🧪 Part 4 — Demonstration Requirements

Your application must demonstrate all six mechanisms.

| Mechanism        | Required Demonstration                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| localStorage     | Persistent cart/session data          |
| sessionStorage   | Temporary browsing/session data       |
| Cookies          | Shared preference/session information |
| Query Parameters | Product/navigation information        |
| Custom Events    | Add-to-cart communication             |
| Shared Redux     | Centralized cross-MFE cart state      |

---

# 🔍 Part 5 — Comparison & Justification

Create a section in your README called:

```text
## Data-Sharing Mechanism Comparison
```

Compare all six mechanisms.

Your comparison should include:

| Mechanism      | Persistence  | Communication  | Coupling | Best Use Case                    | Limitations               |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| localStorage   | Long-term    | Indirect       | Low      | Persistent client data           | Browser-only              |
| sessionStorage | Session      | Indirect       | Low      | Temporary session data           | Limited lifetime          |
| Cookies        | Configurable | Browser/Server | Low      | Small session/preferences        | Size/security constraints |
| Query Params   | URL-based    | Navigation     | Low      | Shareable navigation state       | Visible in URL            |
| Custom Events  | Runtime      | Direct events  | Low      | MFE communication                | Requires active listeners |
| Shared Redux   | Runtime      | Direct state   | Higher   | Complex shared application state | Stronger coupling         |

> The table above is a starting point. You must expand the explanation in your own words based on your implementation.

# 🎓 Final Goal

The purpose of this assignment is **not simply to build a shopping cart**.

The main objective is to understand how independently developed Micro Frontends can **communicate, share state, and remain as decoupled as possible**.

By the end of the assignment, you should be able to answer:

> **"If I have two independent Micro Frontends, how should they share data, and which mechanism should I choose for a particular use case?"**

You should be able to justify your choice between:

```text
localStorage
      ↓
sessionStorage
      ↓
Cookies
      ↓
Query Parameters
      ↓
Custom Events
      ↓
Shared Redux State
```

based on **persistence, coupling, security, scalability, communication requirements, and application architecture**.

---

## 📅 Deadline

Please submit your GitHub repo link by: 25 - August - 2026

---

## 💡 Tips

- Start all remote apps before running the shell.
- Keep each remote app small and focused.
- Test what happens when one remote app is stopped.
- Use clear component names and folder structure.
- Read the Module Federation and Vite plugin documentation carefully.

---

## 🚀 Good Luck!

Build it, experiment with the different data-sharing approaches, and most importantly — **understand why you chose each approach, not just how to implement it.**
